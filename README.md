# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
I hve already covered the pros and cons of using Object Relation Mapping (ORM) libraries in a different repository(https://github.com/CaliFlowers/sql-challenge/blob/main/README.md). This mini=project is a full demonstration of why ORM exists; and how it can be useful. While I have already covered weather analysis using Python in a previous mini=project. (https://github.com/CaliFlowers/Python_APIChallenge), this mini=project approaches a more focused geographic location to do a similar analysis; but using SQL Alchemy. 
## WHY SQLALCHEMY
It might be baffling to some people why an otherwised experienced Python or SQL programmer might want to indulge the headache of performing SQL queries in Python. However, one can also not ignore the value of data normalization and the many benefits of using relational databases. As baffling as it might seem, many people who possess large quantities of datahave to store their data in Relational Databases. 

## API SSERVICES
Application Program Interfaces are ab excellent method for sharing and retrieving data. However, one notices a problem in that lare datasets work best when stored in relational databases; while API services typically tend to be designed with Python in mind. So how can an SQL database effectively interface with a Python=based query?

One obvious answer is an ORM.
